This is the website for the Nerve Excitability Test (NET).

* The JavaScript in `res/templates/` is statically hosted at https://nervenorms.bellstone.ca.
* The go functions (`convert`, `norms`, `outliers`, and `participants`) are hosted as Google Cloud Functions.
* A few sample data files are in `res/data`, but the main data files are in a different repository.
