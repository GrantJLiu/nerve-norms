package mem

/*

The mem package is used to load and store MEM files.
* `mem.go` contains the main type for MEM files and code to import them. `mem.Import` is the main function to be used from this package.
* `reader.go` reads a MEM file line by line.
* `types.go` contains miscellaneous types.
* The other files implement necessary functions to parse a single section of a MEM file.

This package currently exports a lot of things that shouldn't be exported.
